properties:
    int-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        The INT (interrupt) pin defaults to active low when produced by the sensor.
        The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
        the signal that is presented to the driver.

    int-clr-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        The CLEAR pin defaults to active low when consumed by the sensor.
        The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
        the signal that is presented to the driver.

    pol-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        The POL (polarity) pin defaults to active high when consumed by the sensor.
        The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
        the signal that is presented to the driver.
    
    shdn-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        The SHDN (shutdown) pin defaults to active low when consumed by the sensor.
        The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
        the signal that is presented to the driver.

    shunt-resistance:
        type: int
        required: true
        description: |
          Resistence of the shunt resistor in milliohms
